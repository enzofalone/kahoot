# kahoot (clone)

The main goal for this project was to

- Learn about Websockets at a greater depth
- Interact back and forth with events between backend and frontend

some stuff such as integrating a database and a quiz creator feature sounds cool but i had to scope this down
so I can move on with another project ideas that dive into other interesting concepts.

fun fact: It was going to be originally a jackbox clone but it was going to be much more work and I would not learn much more
