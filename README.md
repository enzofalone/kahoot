# kahoot (clone)

The main goal for this project was to

- Learn about Websockets at a greater depth
- Interact back and forth with events between backend and frontend

some stuff such as integrating a database and a quiz creator feature sounds cool but i had to scope this down (it was going to be originally a jackbox clone but it was going to be much more work doing the same thing over and over)
so I can move on with another project ideas that dive into other interesting concepts
